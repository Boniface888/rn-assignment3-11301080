Here's a brief description of each component's usage in React Native:

1. **View**: The View component is a fundamental building block for creating user interfaces in React Native. It's similar to the `<div>` element in web development and is used to structure and style UI components. Views can contain other Views or other UI components like Text or Image.

2. **Text**: The Text component is used to display text in React Native applications. It's similar to the `<span>` or `<p>` elements in web development. Text components can be styled using various properties such as fontSize, color, and fontWeight.

3. **ScrollView**: ScrollView is a component used for displaying a scrollable list of components or views. It's particularly useful when you have a large amount of content that exceeds the available space on the screen. ScrollView allows users to scroll through the content vertically or horizontally.

4. **TextInput**: The TextInput component provides a way for users to input text into the application. It's equivalent to the `<input>` element in web development. TextInput can be used for various purposes such as entering text, passwords, or numeric input. It supports features like placeholder text, secure text entry, and keyboard customization.

5. **FlatList**: FlatList is a high-performance component used for displaying lists of data in React Native. It's optimized for rendering large datasets efficiently by only rendering the items that are currently visible on the screen. FlatList also provides features like scrolling, item selection, and performance optimizations through the use of key extractor and renderItem props.

6. **Image**: The Image component is used to display images in React Native applications. It supports various image formats such as PNG, JPEG, GIF, and SVG. Images can be loaded from local resources or network URLs. The Image component also provides features like resizing, cropping, and caching for better performance.![Screenshot_20240531-162341](https://github.com/Boniface888/rn-assignment3-11301080/assets/170082123/a1e59611-b154-4ad2-902c-9e8d19e95834)
